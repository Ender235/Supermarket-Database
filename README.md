This program is a supermarket database management system that uses csv files as its storage mechanich and uses pyqt5 to create a visual interface
To run it you need to install the following libraries:

1. pyqt5 (pip install pyqt5)
2. functools (pip install functools)
3. pandas (pip install pandas)

So far, I have to fix:
- Key error with dictionaries
- Image downloading and apearing
- maybe search, depends how im feeling about it

If anything dosent work feel free to message me.
