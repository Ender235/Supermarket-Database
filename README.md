This program is a supermarket database management system that uses csv files as its storage mechanich and uses pyqt5 to create a visual interface
To run it you need to install the following libraries:

1. pyqt5 (pip install pyqt5)
2. functools (pip install functools)
3. pandas (pip install pandas)

To run the code you must go to the file called "compiled_code.py" and then execute it.

If you want to clear the default database, you have to run "setup_database.py" and then use the terminal to do whatever it asks you to do to get the database how you want it.

If anything dosent work feel free to message me.
